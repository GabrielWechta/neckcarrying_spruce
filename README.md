*The discovery of such behavior is one of the important achievements of
chaos theory. Another is the methodologies which have been designed for
a precise scientific evaluation of the presence of chaotic behavior in mathe-
matical models as well as in real phenomena. Using these methodologies,
it is now possible, in principle, to estimate the ‘predictability horizon’ of a
system. This is the mathematical, physical, or time parameter limit within
which predictability is ideally possible and beyond which we will never be
able to predict with certainty. It has been established, for example, that the
predictability horizon in weather forecasting is not more than about two or
three weeks. This means that no matter how many more weather stations are
included in the observation, no matter how much more accurately weather
data are collected and analyzed, we will never be able to predict the weather
with any degree of numerical accuracy beyond this horizon of time.*

There is no such thing as weather prediction. There are only guesses and short memory. Why do you think pretty weatherwomen are so pretty? 
Or is it?
